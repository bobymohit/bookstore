Structure
Describe the overall structure:

Header Files and Macros: "We include necessary header files like iostream, windows.h, and mysql.h for database connectivity. We also define constants for database connection parameters and application-specific settings."
Global Variables: "Global variables for the MySQL connection and query results are declared."
Date Structure: "A simple structure to handle dates."
Classes: "We have defined six main classes: books, suppliers, purchases, employees, members, and sales, each representing different entities in the system."
Detailed Explanation
For each class, give a brief overview of its purpose and key member functions. For example:

Books Class

"The books class handles operations related to books. Key functions include:

add(): Adds a new book record to the database.
update_price(): Updates the price of an existing book.
search(): Searches for a book by its ID.
update(): Updates the inventory based on received orders.
display(): Displays all books."
Suppliers Class

"The suppliers class manages supplier information with functions to add, remove, and search suppliers."

Purchases Class

"The purchases class handles book orders, including placing new orders and marking orders as received or canceled."

Employees Class

"The employees class manages employee records, including adding new employees, updating salaries, and assigning manager status."

Members Class

"The members class handles bookshop members, allowing for adding new members and searching existing members."

Sales Class

"The sales class manages sales transactions, including adding new sales and calculating total sales for the year."

Functionality
Discuss the main functionalities:
"Each class interacts with the MySQL database using SQL queries. The program includes main menu functions to navigate through different operations, such as managing books, suppliers, purchases, employees, members, and sales."

Error Handling and Improvements
Address error handling and potential improvements:
"Currently, error handling is minimal, primarily checking if queries were successful. Improvements could include:

Enhanced error handling and logging.
Improved input validation to prevent SQL injection.
More robust and user-friendly interface.
Modularizing code further for better readability and maintenance.".
